# Wordle Clone App ⬛️🟨🟩🟨⬛️
##### _Desktop only_ 
### Description

Almost everyday I look forward to figuring out what the word of the day is on Wordle, so I thought why not create a clone! Except you won't have to wait 24 hours to play again 😉

#### How To Play:

If you've been in a hole and never played this New York Times favorite game, no worries, I'll help 🤗
The object of the game is to guess what the random word is within 6 tries. Typing either on your own keyboard or using the built in, you'll type in the first 5 letter word you can think of.
</br>
**Color code:**
</br>

🟩 Green means the letter belongs and it has the correct placement
</br>
🟨 Yellow means the letter belongs however it does not have the correct placement
</br>
⬛️ Black means the letter does not belong at all
</br>

The built in keyboard reflects the letters you've already used, using the same color coding system as above.
