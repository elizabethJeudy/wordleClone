# Wordle Clone App

### Description

Almost everyday I look forward to figuring out what the word of the day is on Wordle, so I thought why not create a clone! Except you won't have to wait 24 hours to play again!

### How To Play:

If you've been in a hole and never played this New York Times favorite game, no worries, I'll help ðŸ¤—
The object of the game is to guess what the random word is within 6 tries. Typing either on your keyboard (only on desktop) or using the built in, you'll type in the first 5 letter word you can think of.
Color code:

- Green means the letter belongs and it has the correct placement
  Yellow means the letter belongs however it does not have the correct placement
  Gray means the letter does not belong at all

The built in keyboard reflects the letters you've already used, using the same color coding system as above.

Try to be strategic and think of the letters in play
_hint_ sometimes there are double letters and its okay to use a letter that was previously wrong in order to help you out!
